Short term stuff:
X fix build, find out why tests are not run
- find a better way to categorize stuff like pasta, rice, ... Categorize using AH shop in Ede 
X- read data from file
X add date to menu and vegetable ingredients in shopping list
X clean up var constructs in ShoppingListItem class
- fix TODOs
- Allow '-' as a recipe to indicate no menu is needed on that day
- Avoid crash if recipe contains no more than a title, in general improve non-happy flow when parsing
- Extend menu with list of extra's that are not related to a particular day
- Allow more than one dish per day
