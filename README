Shopping list is a vehicle to teach myself Scala.
It also serves a real purpose because it is supposed to generate shopping lists optimized for the super market I visit each week. 
There have been several incarnations of this program: a Oracle Forms version (lost in the mists of time, this is probably a good thing), a Drools version (worked, but was too ambitious because it tried to magically generate a menu as well as a shopping list)
and a couple of Scala versions that tried to support natural language to specify recipes.
None of these previous versions were actually used. While I learned a lot and had a good time doing so, the shopping list problem remained unsolved. Still, I spent lots of time on Saturdays running through 
my favourite super market knowing full well I'd forget stuff. My kids are now old enough to nag their father about this, so action was necessary.
Ambition can be a dangerous thing if taken in large quantities, so I aimed for an easier goal (and now try to sell this as an advantage since easier goals that deliver working software are OK in true agile spirit).

The road map now looks like this:
- Generate a shopping list based on simple recipes specified as name:value lines in a text string stored in the main function and a menu specified likewise. The domain terms will be in Dutch. (DONE)
- Configure the recipes and menu in text files (DONE)
- Enter the recipes and menu using a GUI
- Generate a menu based on constraints like the season, the amount of time the cook has on a particular day and other fuzzy logic (some of the old ambition shining through here)

Still, the goal to learn always have a strong influence. This will lead to solutions that might be over engineered or rewritten several times just to get it right.
